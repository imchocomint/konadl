# konadl
A vibe-coded (in Google Gemini) tool to search and download images from yande.re in Python using PyQt6. Highly configurable for an app like this.

## Usage
Grab the binary from Release and run it.

## Configure
The config file is at `$HOME/.config/konadl`. It's created on first run if not available.

Go check it out and see if you can customize anything.

## Bugs
- [ ] button colors not syncing. May find a way to work around this
- [ ] transparency. I've personally fixed this (not by an AI), but that may be faulty for some people. Please report in Issues.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Automatically set the latest downloaded image as the background and also set the colorscheme based on it using wallust.
- [ ] Adding support for Konachan (hence the name)
- [ ] idk

## License
I've decided to put this on public domain because I created this from an AI model that trained from both noncopyrighted and copyrighted material, so I want to give something back. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

## Side note
yande.re is full of hentai and having barely any wallpaper-worthy images.
